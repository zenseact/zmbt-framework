# You can use this CODEOWNERS file to define individuals or teams that are
# responsible for code in the repository.

# A CODEOWNERS file uses a pattern that follows most of the same rules used in
# gitignore files, with some exceptions. The pattern is followed by one or more
# GitHub usernames or team names using the standard @username or @org/team-name
# format. You can also use email addresses if you prefer. Each line is a file
# pattern followed by one or more owners.
#
# Example 1: @global-owner1 @global-owner2
# Example 2: .js @js-owner

# For more information, see https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-
#   your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/
#   about-code-owners.
